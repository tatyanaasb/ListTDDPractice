# TDD Practice with Lists

This exercise will help you practice writing tests in xUnit in addition to learning the syntax, properties, and methods of the List<> class.

This application contains a project with an empty Program.cs class and a test project with a ListTests.cs class.  ListTests.cs contains multiple failing tests related to lists.  Your goal is to modify the ListTests.cs class to get the tests to pass.  You do not need to make modifications to the Program.cs file.

## Instructions

1. Download the project onto your computer.
1. Open the project in Visual Studio.
1. Open the ListTests.cs file.
1. Run the tests and see them all fail.
1. Follow the instructions given in the comments and modify the tests one by one to get them to pass.
